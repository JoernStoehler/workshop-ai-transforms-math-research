## Summary from papers-summary.md

Transformers encode input-output functions as directions in activation space called function vectors. These vectors can be extracted, transplanted between contexts, and composed through arithmetic - adding vectors improves performance on both tasks simultaneously. This reveals tasks as geometric objects in high-dimensional space.
