## Summary from papers-summary.md

Deep connections exist between transformer in-context learning and classical learning theory. VC dimension and Rademacher complexity frameworks extend to transformer architectures, providing rigorous generalization guarantees. The connection reveals in-context learning as a form of empirical risk minimization with implicit regularization.
